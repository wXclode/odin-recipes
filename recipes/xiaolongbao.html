        <li>200 g high protein flour</li>
        <li>85 - 100 ml warm water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>some shredded fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons of white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making the Jelly</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Blanch the skin for 5 minutes to remove the bad smell.</li>
       <li>Clean it and remove the fat because you don’t want your soup to be too oily.</li>
       <li>Cut it into thin strips.</li>
       <li>Prepare a pot of water (1.8 L of water). Put in your pork skin. Bring it to a boil and then down to low heat. Stew it for 1 hour.</li>
       <li>After 1 hour, add a bunch of spring onion, some slices of ginger, a tbsp of Chinese cooking wine, 2 tsp of sugar, a tsp of white pepper, and a tsb of salt. Keep stewing on low heat for another hour.</li>
       <li>Strain the broth into a container. After stewing, you should have about 400 ml broth left. Put it in the fridge for at least 6 hours. Skin has a lot collagen, which dissolves in the water during stewing. When the temperature goes down, it turns into a jelly.</li>
       <li>Carefully mince the jelly. Make sure there are not big chunks.</li>
       <li>Set it aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the Filling (25-30 Dumplings)</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>You can do this while the jelly is being formed in the fridge.</li>
       <li>Use some white part of the spring onion and ginger to make a sauce. Blend them with 3 tablespoons of water. Strain it.</li>
       <li>Pour the sauce into the ground pork.</li>
       <li>Add white sugar,dark soy sauce, sesame oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.</li>
       <li>Stir it until the pork absorbs all the sauce. Add the vegetables into the meat. And Combine them. You can switch it with other vegetables like water chestnut or radish.</li>
       <li>Last step is to mix it with the minced jelly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the Wraps</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>You need about 200 g of high protein flour.</li>
       <li>Add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and mix it well.</li>
       <li>Pour warm water in 3 parts.and mix the flour</li>
       <li>Knead the dough until smooth.</li>
       <li>Knead the dough again for 5-10 minutes, to squeeze the air out.</li>
       <li>Cover it; let it sit for another 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Cut the dough in half. Roll and Pull it into a long even strip.</li>
       <li>Cut it into small pieces. Turn it after every cut to get even pieces. Each one should be about 12 grams.</li>
       <li>Sprinkle some flour in case they stick to each other.</li>
       <li>Flatten them with your hand.</li>
       <li>Roll it into a small round wrapper with thick middle and thin edge. The size should be about 8-10cm long across.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Close the Dumbplings</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>This is the most important step to make them look great.</li>
       <li>Take a wrap and put enough meat so it’s almost full. I put a little bit more than a tbsp.</li>
       <li>Lift one part of the edge and pinch it to make a pleat. Continue all the way around.</li>
       <li>At the end, pinch it together to close the dumpling.</li>
       <li>Normally, each dumpling should have 10-12 pleats in total. Don’t worry too much about this your first time- it will take some practice to make it look perfect.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steaming</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Put parchment paper in the steamer</li>
       <li>Place the DUmplings and leave some space between the xiao long bao.</li>
       <li>Bring the water to a boil, then put the steamer in and let it steam it for 5 minutes on high heat.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Dumpling Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>Mix the shredded fresh ginger, white vinegar and soy sauce</li>
    </ol>
