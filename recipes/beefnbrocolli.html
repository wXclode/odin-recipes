    <p>traditional dish with beef and brocolli"</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300 g 10.5 oz beef</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp Chinese cooking wine</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>White pepper powder to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp satay sauce</li>
        <li>200g brocolli</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp ginger</li>
        <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tbsp satay sauce</li>
        <li>a splash of water if needed</li>
        <li>a drizzle of fish sauce to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into 2-3mm thick pieces. Marinade it with 1.5 tbsp of Shao xing wine, 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of sugar, 1/2 tsp of baking soda, and some white pepper to taste. Mix them and make sure you get in between every piece of meat. Once the seasoning is well combined, add 1 tbsp of satay paste. Mix again. Set it aside for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Separate the big leaves from the stem. Cut the leaves in half so they wonâ€™t be too stiff while stir-frying. To the stems, you just slice it with an angle into 1/4 of an inch thick pieces. The stems and the leaves need different amounts of time to cook so they will go into the wok in a certain order.</li>
        <li>Besides that, grate 2 cloves of garlic and 1 tsp of ginger. Set it aside.</li>
        <li>Heat your wok until it is smoking. Add 3 tbsp of oil. Give it a toss so the oil covers the bottom. Wait for it to be smoking as well. Add the marinaded beef. Spread it out. Let it cook until one side is seared. Keep stirring and cook it to your desire doneness. Turn off the heat. Take out the beef and set it aside.</li>
        <li>There should be some oil left in the wok. Use that to cook the broccoli. The stems go in first. Stir for a minute and then add the leaves. Keep stirring. Add the garlic, ginger, 1/2 tbsp of satay paste, and 2 tsp of oyster sauce. Mix until the seasoning is well combined. The grated garlic will make the wok a bit gooey. You just add a splash of water and loosen it up. Introduce the beef back into the wok. Give it a taste. If you feel like it needs more salt, you can add a drizzle of fish sauce instead of salt. The flavor goes good with the satay paste. Enjoy!</li>
